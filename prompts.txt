You are given Reddit comment threads related to a specific post .

Before Analysis strictly check if the post and comments mentions Amazon(R) or not. If you are very sure it is not related to Amazon then just return ***Not Sure If the post is related to Amazon*** " if it is related to Amazon then continue with the below analysis.

Analyze the comments and generate a structure in the exact format shown below.


⚠️ Guidelines:
- Don't make any assumptions and just give data from the comments provided nothing extra.
- Sections 1, 2, 3, and 6 should be strictly focused on **Amazon**.
- Section 4 (**Comparisons**) can mention any retailer, even if Amazon is not explicitly referenced.
- Section 5 (**Basic Summary**) should only cover Amazon-related content.

Format to follow:

---

1) **Overall Sentiment**  
State the overall sentiment toward **Amazon**: *positive*, *negative*, or *neutral*, along with a confidence score (e.g., negative - 78%).

2) **Categories of Comments**  
Group user comments **about Amazon only and leave comparisons with other retailers for this section ** summarize them and organize by:
- Based on cost (strictly consider those comments that mention cost, price, offers, discounts or value of Amazon products)
- Based on delivery (consider those comments that mention speed/time, delays or anything related to shipping or delivery)  
- Availability (strictly consider those comments mentioning stock availability or lack thereof)
- Amazon team member comments (strictly consider those comments that look like it is from a Amazon team member or employee)
- Other categories (If a comment does not fit into the above categories then it should be placed here and here also we will divide the comments based on sentiment(positive, negative, neutral))
Under each category divide the comments based on sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and provide a summary of the comments.
support all the summaries with all the comments that were used to generate the summary, if for a particular category like Based on delivery there are no comments then say no comments 
The output should stick to the below format and the content should be fully derived from the reddit post itself. This is just a sample format.
'**Based on delivery (speed/time):**  
	Positive - Summary of positive comments around this category
		+ Example of positive comments [User id of commentor], we can have multiple comments here, listed in points.
	Negative - Summary of negative comments around this category
	    + Example of negative comments [User id of commentor], we can have multiple comments here, listed in points.
	This format can be used for all the categories mentioned in the comments.

3) **Valuable Feedbacks**  (this is a very critical section so please don't make any assumptions and just give data from the comments provided nothing extra)
List specific suggestions where users mention **what could improve Amazon's experience** or hoped for cases where Amazon could have certain features that would improve guest experience.  
For each feedback, include:  
- A **summary** of the insight  
- All **verbatim user comments** that led to this insight along with the user_name who commented it in the square brackets.

4) **Comparisons**  
Include any comments mentioning other retailers (e.g., Walmart, Costco, Amazon, Best Buy) — whether or not they are compared to Amazon. For each:
- Name of the retailer and number of comments considered (both positive and negative)
- What was said  
- Sentiment of the mention (positive/negative/neutral)
- All **verbatim user comments** that led to this insight along with the user_name who commented it in square brackets
  The output should be in the below format and the content should be fully derived from the reddit post itself. This is just a sample format. -
  '**Comparisons**:
	* **Walmart**: (total number of comments) comments ((number of positive comments) positive, (number of negative comments) negative)
	Positive - Summary of positive comments.
		+ Example of positive comments [User id of commentor], we can have multiple comments here, listed in points.
	Negative - Summary of negative comments.
	    + Example of negative comments [User id of commentor], we can have multiple comments here, listed in points.
	This format can be used for all the retailers mentioned in the comments.

Write a concise 5-8 sentence summary capturing the **main themes and insights about Amazon** from the discussion.

6) **Number of Unique User Comments Considered**  
Give the total count of distinct **Amazon-related** user comments used to generate this output.
