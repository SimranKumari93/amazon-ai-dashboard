# Amazon Sale Sentiment Analysis & LLM Training Pipeline

## 📌 Project Overview

This project automates the **collection, cleaning, and sentiment analysis** of Reddit discussions related to **Amazon sales**.
It extracts customer opinions, identifies trending products, and prepares structured datasets for **training a custom LLM** specialized in e-commerce discussions.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Large-scale e-commerce events (e.g., Amazon Great Indian Festival, Prime Day) generate **thousands of customer comments** daily on online forums.
Manually tracking and analyzing them is **slow and error-prone**.

This project solves that problem by:

* Automating Reddit data collection from sale-related discussions.
* Cleaning and filtering data for **only relevant insights**.
* Applying **AI sentiment analysis** to gauge public opinion.
* Producing datasets ready for **LLM fine-tuning** in retail-specific contexts.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Automatic Reddit comment scraping via **PRAW API**.
* Text cleaning & relevance filtering.
* AI-powered **sentiment classification**.
* Raw and processed data saved in CSV format.
* Ready-to-train datasets for custom LLMs.
